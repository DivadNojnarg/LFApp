 abstract = {The threshold selection problem is solved by minimizing the cross entropy between the image and its segmented version. The cross entropy is formulated in a pixel-to-pixel basis between the two images and a computationally attractive algorithm employing the histogram is developed. Without making a priori assumptions about the population distribution, this method provides an unbiased estimate of a binarized version of the image in an information theoretic sense.},

@article{Zack.1977,
 abstract = {An automatic system for detecting and counting sister chromatid exchanges in human chromosomes has been developed. Metaphase chromosomes from lymphocytes which had incorporated 5-bromodeoxyuridine for two replication cycles were treated with the dye 33258 Hoechst and photodegraded so that the sister chromatids exhibited differential Giemsa staining. A computer-controlled television-microscope system was used to acquire digitized metaphase spread images by direct scanning of microscope slides. Individual objects in the images were identified by a thresholding procedure. The probability that each object was a single, separate chromosome was estimated from size and shape measurements. An analysis of the spatial relationships of the dark-chromatid regions of each object yielded a set of possible exchange locations and estimated probabilities that such locations corresponded to sister chromatid exchanges. A normalized estimate of the sister chromatid exchange frequency was obtained by summing the joint probabilities that a location contained an exchange within a single, separate chromosome over the set of chromosomes from one or more cells and dividing by the expected value of the total chromosome area analyzed. Comparison with manual scoring of exchanges showed satisfactory agreement up to levels of approximately 30 sister chromatid exchanges/cell, or slightly more than twice control levels. The processing time for this automated sister chromatid exchange detection system was comparable to that of manual scoring.},

@article{Pau.2010,
 abstract = {SUMMARY

EBImage provides general purpose functionality for reading, writing, processing and analysis of images. Furthermore, in the context of microscopy-based cellular assays, EBImage offers tools to segment cells and extract quantitative cellular descriptors. This allows the automation of such tasks using the R programming language and use of existing tools in the R environment for signal processing, statistical modeling, machine learning and data visualization.

This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: • produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification • superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales • add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression • save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse • create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots • approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{\textless} • Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system • New scales, stats and geoms added throughout • Additional practice exercises • A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() • Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},
