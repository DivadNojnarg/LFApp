 abstract = {Microarray images, which allow the analysis of hybridization expressions of genes, have been one of the most widely used high-throughput technologies with many different applications. Accurate and automatic microarray image analysis is very important since researchers trust the information provided in these experiments and construct conclusions based on the results produced by the software responsible in analyzing the hybridized arrays. Every microarray image contains thousands of spots, so how to do the spots finding in microarray images accurately and automatically is very meaningful. There are always some problems, such as rotation and distortion, in a microarray image caused by mechanical errors and/or optical errors in the system. All these problems will hinder doing analysis automatically. Early research has worked out several algorithms to deal with the rotation problem, but those algorithms can not handle microarray images with distortions. In this paper, we propose a robust spots finding method to deal with both rotation and/or distortion in microarray images. The proposed method provides automatic gridding and can handle a microarray image with different type of rotation (global or sub-array rotation) and optical distortions.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

DNA microarrays are an experimental technology which consists in arrays of thousands of discrete DNA sequences that are printed on glass microscope slides. Image analysis is an important aspect of microarray experiments. The aim of this step is to reduce an image of spots into a table with a measure of the intensity for each spot. Efficient, accurate and automatic analysis of DNA spot images is essential in order to use this technology in laboratory routines.

RESULTS

We present an automatic non-supervised set of algorithms for a fast and accurate spot data extraction from DNA microarrays using morphological operators which are robust to both intensity variation and artefacts. The approach can be summarised as follows. Initially, a gridding algorithm yields the automatic segmentation of the microarray image into spot quadrants which are later individually analysed. Then the analysis of the spot quadrant images is achieved in five steps. First, a pre-quantification, the spot size distribution law is calculated. Second, the background noise extraction is performed using a morphological filtering by area. Third, an orthogonal grid provides the first approach to the spot locus. Fourth, the spot segmentation or spot boundaries definition is carried out using the watershed transformation. And fifth, the outline of detected spots allows the signal quantification or spot intensities extraction; in this respect, a noise model has been investigated. The performance of the algorithm has been compared with two packages: ScanAlyze and Genepix, showing its robustness and precision.},

@article{Bariamis.2010,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays are a well established technology for studying gene expression. A microarray image is obtained by laser scanning a hybridized cDNA microarray, which consists of thousands of spots representing chains of cDNA sequences, arranged in a two-dimensional array. The separation of the spots into distinct cells is widely known as microarray image gridding.

METHODS

In this paper we propose M3G, a novel method for automatic gridding of cDNA microarray images based on the maximization of the margin between the rows and the columns of the spots. Initially the microarray image rotation is estimated and then a pre-processing algorithm is applied for a rough spot detection. In order to diminish the effect of artefacts, only a subset of the detected spots is selected by matching the distribution of the spot sizes to the normal distribution. Then, a set of grid lines is placed on the image in order to separate each pair of consecutive rows and columns of the selected spots. The optimal positioning of the lines is determined by maximizing the margin between these rows and columns by using a maximum margin linear classifier, effectively facilitating the localization of the spots.

RESULTS

The experimental evaluation was based on a reference set of microarray images containing more than two million spots in total. The results show that M3G outperforms state of the art methods, demonstrating robustness in the presence of noise and artefacts. More than 98{\%} of the spots reside completely inside their respective grid cells, whereas the mean distance between the spot center and the grid cell center is 1.2 pixels.

CONCLUSIONS

The proposed method performs highly accurate gridding in the presence of noise and artefacts, while taking into account the input image rotation. Thus, it provides the potential of achieving perfect gridding for the vast majority of the spots.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Microarray analysis represents a powerful way to test scientific hypotheses on the functionality of cells. The measurements consider the whole genome, and the large number of generated data requires sophisticated analysis. To date, no gold-standard for the analysis of microarray images has been established. Due to the lack of a standard approach there is a strong need to identify new processing algorithms.

METHODS

We propose a novel approach based on hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) for unsupervised spot segmentation. Prior to segmentation, morphological operations were applied for the identification of co-localized groups of spots. A grid alignment was performed to determine the borderlines between rows and columns of spots. PDEs were applied to detect the inflection points within each column and row; vertical and horizontal luminance profiles were evolved respectively. The inflection points of the profiles determined borderlines that confined a spot within adapted rectangular areas. A subsequent k-means clustering determined the pixels of each individual spot and its local background.

RESULTS

We evaluated the approach for a data set of microarray images taken from the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD). The data set is based on two studies on global gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis Thaliana. We computed values for spot intensity, regression ratio, and coefficient of determination. For spots with irregular contours and inner holes, we found intensity values that were significantly different from those determined by the GenePix Pro microarray analysis software. We determined the set of differentially expressed genes from our intensities and identified more activated genes than were predicted by the GenePix software.

CONCLUSIONS

Our method represents a worthwhile alternative and complement to standard approaches used in industry and academy. We highlight the importance of our spot segmentation approach, which identified supplementary important genes, to better explains the molecular mechanisms that are activated in a defense responses to virus and pathogen infection.},

These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.AVAILABILITYSoftware implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONAdditional figures may be found at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/{\~{}}bolstad/normalize/index.html},

 abstract = {Protein microarray technology possesses some of the greatest potential for providing direct information on protein function and potential drug targets. For example, functional protein microarrays are ideal tools suited for the mapping of biological pathways. They can be used to study most major types of interactions and enzymatic activities that take place in biochemical pathways and have been used for the analysis of simultaneous multiple biomolecular interactions involving protein-protein, protein-lipid, protein-DNA and protein-small molecule interactions. Because of this unique ability to analyze many kinds of molecular interactions en masse, the requirement of very small sample amount and the potential to be miniaturized and automated, protein microarrays are extremely well suited for protein profiling, drug discovery, drug target identification and clinical prognosis and diagnosis. The aim of this review is to summarize the most recent developments in the production, applications and analysis of protein microarrays.},

 abstract = {Background: Melioidosis, caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is an often-fatal infectious disease with a high prevalence across tropical areas. Clinical presentation can vary from abscess formation to pneumonia and septicaemia. We assessed the global burden of melioidosis, expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), for the year 2015. Methods: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature for human melioidosis cases between 1990 and 2015 was performed. Using a broad search strategy, no language restrictions and combinations of search terms, Burkholderia spp. and disease names, all relevant articles were screened on title, abstract, and full text. Quantitative data from cases including mortality, age, sex, infectious and post-infectious sequelae, antibiotic treatment and symptom duration were extracted. This information was then combined with established disability weights and expert panel discussions to construct an incidence-based disease model. The disease model was integrated with established global incidence and mortality estimates to calculate global melioidosis DALYs. Findings: 2 888 articles were screened, of which 475 eligible studies containing quantitative information were retained. Sepsis/septic shock and pneumonia were the most common outcomes, occurring in 18.0{\%} (1526/8469), 12.1{\%} (1004/8298) and 35.7{\%} (3633/10175) of patients respectively. The male to female ratio of infection was 2:1. We estimate that in 2015, the global burden of melioidosis was 4·6 million DALYs (UI 3·2-6·6) or 84·3 per 100 000 people (UI 57·5-120·0). Years of life lost (YLL) accounted for 98·9{\%} (UI 97·7-99·5) of the total DALYs. Interpretation: Our estimates enable comparison with other tropical diseases which are already recognised as neglected and give policy makers the information necessary to reconsider melioidosis as a major neglected tropical disease.

For example, population expansion and ageing, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-AIDS epidemics, have exerted pressure to decentralize the practice of healthcare outside of traditional settings to bring care to those in need. Upstream of patient management, diagnosis is aimed at adequately orienting medical decisions, and considerable efforts have been made to make this process faster and more efficient. However, there are several diseases and medical conditions that may/will benefit from technologies and tests that can be performed closer to the patient, at the point of care or even in the home. In this review, and in light of the paradox that technology and assay developers and healthcare officials must take into consideration for advancing human health in developed and developing countries, we present an overview of rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases at the point of care and of technologies that may contribute to enhancement of the worldwide point-of-care testing market.},

Then, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approach is presented for the analysis of the individual spot images. The main advantages of the proposed methodology are modeling flexibility and adaptability to the data, which are well-known strengths of GMM. The maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori approaches are used to estimate the GMM parameters via the expectation maximization algorithm. The proposed approach has the ability to detect and compensate for artifacts that might occur in microarray images. This is accomplished by a model-based criterion that selects the number of the mixture components. We present numerical experiments with artificial and real data where we compare the proposed approach with previous ones and existing software tools for microarray image analysis and demonstrate its advantages.},

@article{Bloom.2019,
 abstract = {The world has developed an elaborate global health system as a bulwark against known and unknown infectious disease threats. The system consists of various formal and informal networks of organizations that serve different stakeholders; have varying goals, modalities, resources, and accountability; operate at different regional levels (i.e., local, national, regional, or global); and cut across the public, private-for-profit, and private-not-for-profit sectors. The evolving global health system has done much to protect and promote human health. However, the world continues to be confronted by longstanding, emerging, and reemerging infectious disease threats. These threats differ widely in terms of severity and probability. They also have varying consequences for morbidity and mortality, as well as for a complex set of social and economic outcomes. To various degrees, they are also amenable to alternative responses, ranging from clean water provision to regulation to biomedical countermeasures. Whether the global health system as currently constituted can provide effective protection against a dynamic array of infectious disease threats has been called into question by recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, dengue, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and influenza and by the looming threat of rising antimicrobial resistance. The concern is magnified by rapid population growth in areas with weak health systems, urbanization, globalization, climate change, civil conflict, and the changing nature of pathogen transmission between human and animal populations. There is also potential for human-originated outbreaks emanating from laboratory accidents or intentional biological attacks. This paper discusses these issues, along with the need for a (possibly self-standing) multi-disciplinary Global Technical Council on Infectious Disease Threats to address emerging global challenges with regard to infectious disease and associated social and economic risks. This Council would strengthen the global health system by improving collaboration and coordination across organizations (e.g., the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, national centers for disease control, pharmaceutical manufacturers, etc.); filling in knowledge gaps with respect to (for example) infectious disease surveillance, research and development needs, financing models, supply chain logistics, and the social and economic impacts of potential threats; and making high-level, evidence-based recommendations for managing global risks associated with infectious disease.},

 abstract = {DNA microarrays are an increasingly important tool that allow biologists to gain insight into the function of thousands of genes in a single experiment. Common to all array-based approaches is the necessity to analyze digital images of the scanned DNA array. The ultimate image analysis goal is to automatically quantify every individual array element (spot), providing information about the amount of DNA bound to a spot. Irrespective of the quantification strategy, the preliminary information to extract about a spot includes the mapping between its location in the digital image and its possibly distorted position in the spot array (gridding). We present a gridding approach divided into a spot-amplification step (matched filter), a rotation estimation step (Radon transform), and a grid spanning step. Quantification of the spots is performed by robustly fitting of a parametric model to pixel intensities with the help of M-estimators. The main advantage of parametric spot fitting is its ability to cope with overlapping spots. If the goodness-of-fit is too bad, a semiparametric spot fitting is employed. We show that our approach is superior to simple quantification strategies such as averaging of the pixel intensities. The system was extensively tested on 1740 images resulting from two DNA libraries.},

In {\textquotedbl}spotted{\textquotedbl} microarrays, slides carrying spots of target DNA are hybridized to fluorescently labeled cDNA from experimental and control cells and the arrays are imaged at two or more wavelengths. In this paper, we perform statistical analysis on images of microarrays and show that quantitating the amount of fluorescent DNA bound to microarrays is subject to considerable uncertainty because of large and small-scale intensity fluctuations within spots, nonadditive background, and fabrication artifacts. Pixel-by-pixel analysis of individual spots can be used to estimate these sources of error and establish the precision and accuracy with which gene expression ratios are determined. Simple weighting schemes based on these estimates are effective in improving significantly the quality of microarray data as it accumulates in a multiexperiment database. We propose that error estimates from image-based metrics should be one component in an explicitly probabilistic scheme for the analysis of DNA microarray data.},

In this work, nonparametric methods using kernel density estimation are applied to segment two-channel cDNA microarray images. This approach groups pixels into both a foreground and a background. The segmentation performance of this model is tested and evaluated with reference to 16 microarray data. In particular, spike genes with various contents are spotted in a microarray to examine and evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation results. Duplicated design is implemented to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The results of this study demonstrate that this method can cluster pixels and estimate statistics regarding spots with high accuracy.},

The use of the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) has found widespread use in areas endemic for this disease. Using this assay, we explored the serologic profile of 275 patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis in the Northern Territory of Australia. Based on a threshold titer of 1:40, the sensitivity of the IHA on admission was 56{\%}. Female patients, those with positive blood cultures, and those with pneumonia independently predicted a negative IHA result. Most patients (68{\%}) with negative admission IHA titers subsequently seroconverted. Most patients (92{\%}) with positive admission IHA titers had persistently positive IHA titers. Relapses were not observed in 36 patients who had a negative IHA at least 1 month after admission, irrespective of initial admission IHA. The IHA has limited utility as a diagnostic test for acute disease, and most patients subsequently have persistently positive titers after recovery from illness.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, holds many of the world's most prevalent arboviral diseases that are also considered the most important travel related arboviral infections. In most cases, flavivirus diagnosis in travelers is primarily based on serology as viremia is often low and typically has already been reduced to undetectable levels when symptoms set in and patients seek medical attention. Serological differentiation between flaviviruses and the false-positive results caused by vaccination and cross-reactivity among the different species, are problematic for surveillance and diagnostics of flaviviruses. Their partially overlapping geographic distribution and symptoms, combined with increase in travel, and preexisting antibodies due to flavivirus vaccinations, expand the need for rapid and reliable multiplex diagnostic tests to supplement currently used methods.

GOAL

We describe the development of a multiplex serological protein microarray using recombinant NS1 proteins for detection of medically important viruses within the genus Flavivirus. Sera from clinical flavivirus patients were used for primary development of the protein microarray.

RESULTS

Results show a high IgG and IgM sensitivity and specificity for individual NS1 antigens, and limited cross reactivity, even within serocomplexes. In addition, the serology based on this array allows for discrimination between infection and vaccination response for JEV vaccine, and no cross-reactivity with TBEV and YFV vaccine induced antibodies when testing for antibodies to other flaviviruses.

CONCLUSION

Based on these data, multiplex NS1-based protein microarray is a promising tool for surveillance and diagnosis of flaviviruses.},

 abstract = {Infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei can result in asymptomatic seroconversion, a single skin lesion that may or may not heal spontaneously, a pneumonia which can be subacute or chronic and mimic tuberculosis or rapidly progressive resulting in fatal overwhelming sepsis. Latency with subsequent activation of disease is well recognized, but very uncommon. Melioidosis also has a myriad of other clinical presentations and diagnosis is often delayed because of this and because of difficulties with laboratory diagnosis and lack of recognition outside melioidosis-endemic regions. The perception of B. pseudomallei as a top tier biothreat agent has driven large funding for research, yet resources for diagnosis and therapy of melioidosis in many endemic locations remain extremely limited, with mortality as high as 50{\%} in comparison to around 10{\%} in regions where state-of-the-art intensive care therapy for sepsis is available. Fatal melioidosis is extremely unlikely from natural infection in a healthy person, provided the diagnosis is made early, ceftazidime or meropenem is commenced and intensive care therapy is available. While biothreat research is directed toward potential aerosol exposure to B. pseudomallei, the overall proportion of melioidosis cases resulting from inhalation rather than from percutaneous inoculation remains entirely uncertain, although the epidemiology supports a shift to inhalation during severe weather events such as cyclones and typhoons. What makes B. pseudomallei such a dangerous organism for patients with diabetes and other selective risk factors remains unclear, but microbial genome-wide association studies linking clinical aspects of melioidosis cases to nonubiquitous or polymorphic B. pseudomallei genes or genomic islands are beginning to uncover specific virulence signatures. Finally, what also remains uncertain is the global phylogeography of B. pseudomallei and whether melioidosis is spreading beyond historical locations or is just being unmasked in Africa and the Americas by better recognition and increased surveillance.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Protein microarrays provide a high-throughput platform to measure protein interactions and associated functions, and can aid in the discovery of cancer biomarkers. The resulting protein microarray data can however be subject to systematic bias and noise, thus requiring a robust data processing, normalization and analysis pipeline to ensure high quality and robust results. To date, a comprehensive data processing pipeline is yet to be developed. Furthermore, a lack of analysis consistency is evident amongst different research groups, thereby impeding collaborative data consolidation and comparison. Thus, we sought to develop an accessible data processing tool using methods that are generalizable to the protein microarray field and which can be adapted to individual array layouts with minimal software engineering expertise.

RESULTS

We developed an improved version of a previously developed pipeline of protein microarray data processing and implemented it as an open source software tool, with particular focus on widening its use and applicability. The Protein Microarray Analyser software presented here includes the following tools: (1) neighbourhood background correction, (2) net intensity correction, (3) user-defined noise threshold, (4) user-defined CV threshold amongst replicates and (5) assay controls, (6) composite 'pin-to-pin' normalization amongst sub-arrays, and (7) 'array-to-array' normalization amongst whole arrays.},

@article{Dalirirad.2019,
 abstract = {A new aptamer-based lateral flow strip assay has been designed and developed for on-site rapid detection of cortisol in sweat. Cortisol in sweat has been identified as a key biomarker to monitor physiological stress. A highly sensitive and specific cortisol sensor was achieved by conjugating cortisol-selective aptamers to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Aptamer-functionalized AuNPs are stable against salt-induced aggregation. When cortisol molecules are present in the sample, they interact with the designed aptamers causing their desorption from the AuNP surface. Free AuNPs can then be captured by reaction with cysteamine immobilized on the test zone of the lateral flow test strip. This enables the visual detection of cortisol within minutes. Important parameters that affect the detection sensitivity in both solution and lateral flow assays, such as the loading density of aptamers per AuNP, salt and cysteamine concentrations, were investigated to provide the optimum assay performance. This hand-held device successfully exhibited a visual limit of detection of 1 ng/mL, readily covering the normal range of free cortisol in sweat (8--140 ng/mL). No significant cross reactivity to other stress biomarkers was observed. The advantages of this paper-based biosensor over previously reported test strips include the use of aptamers (which are more stable, simpler to use and lower cost than antibodies) and a simplified lateral flow assay (LFA) strip design (without the use of complementary aptamers in the test line). The resulting LFA aptasensor provides a rapid, sensitive, user-friendly and cost-effective point of care device for cortisol detection in sweat and other biofluids.},

A wealth of documents dealing with HTA have been published over the last three decades. HTA allegedly is one of the bedrocks of regulation and medical decision making. However, counter vailing visions contend that geographical variations in the role that HTA is actually playing within countries pinpoints specific room for improvement. Given our social preferences, cherry-picking HTA's features and successes over the last decades moves it away from its possibility frontier. Some of the most noteworthy hindrances that HTA faces, in several countries, to making headway towards its consolidation as an efficient tool for regulation and decision making are as follows: insufficient resources, delays in assessment, inadequate priority setting, regulatory capture, public distrust, actual influence on regulatory decisions, the need for strengthening international cooperation and harmony, the lack of sound and consistent assessments of diagnostic tests, medical devices and surgical innovations and limited dissemination. Time has come for HTA to take a renewed stand. There is a pressing need to submit HTA to in-depth critical scrutiny},

According to different features, such as content, surface or detection system, there are many types of protein microarrays which can be applied for the identification of disease biomarkers and the characterization of protein expression patterns. However, the analysis and interpretation of the amount of information generated by microarrays remain a challenge. Further data analysis strategies are essential to obtain representative and reproducible results. Therefore, the experimental design is key, since the number of samples and dyes, among others aspects, would define the appropriate analysis method to be used. In this sense, several algorithms have been proposed so far to overcome analytical difficulties derived from fluorescence overlapping and/or background noise. Each kind of microarray is developed to fulfill a specific purpose. Therefore, the selection of appropriate analytical and data analysis strategies is crucial to achieve successful biological conclusions. In the present review, we focus on current algorithms and main strategies for data interpretation.},

Spatial heterogeneity may be corrected using two-dimensional loess smoothing (Colantuoni et al., 2002). Non-linear between-array variation may be corrected using an iterative application of one-dimensional loess smoothing. A method for background correction using a smoothing function rather than simple subtraction is described. These techniques promote within-array spatial uniformity and between-array reproducibility. Their application is illustrated using data from a study of the effects of an insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone, on gene expression in white adipose tissue in diabetic db/db mice. They may also be useful with data from two-channel cDNA microarrays and from oligonucleotide arrays.

The segmented cDNA microarray image is resized and it is used as an input for the proposed artificial neural network. For matching and recognition, we have trained the artificial neural network.

However, it is feasible that other countries will in time adopt a similar regulatory framework, given that many countries are involved in the development process.

 abstract = {Understanding the way in which the immune system responds to infection is central to the development of vaccines and many diagnostics. To provide insight into this area, we fabricated a protein microarray containing 1,205 Burkholderia pseudomallei proteins, probed it with 88 melioidosis patient sera, and identified 170 reactive antigens. This subset of antigens was printed on a smaller array and probed with a collection of 747 individual sera derived from 10 patient groups including melioidosis patients from Northeast Thailand and Singapore, patients with different infections, healthy individuals from the USA, and from endemic and nonendemic regions of Thailand. We identified 49 antigens that are significantly more reactive in melioidosis patients than healthy people and patients with other types of bacterial infections. We also identified 59 cross-reactive antigens that are equally reactive among all groups, including healthy controls from the USA. Using these results we were able to devise a test that can classify melioidosis positive and negative individuals with sensitivity and specificity of 95{\%} and 83{\%}, respectively, a significant improvement over currently available diagnostic assays. Half of the reactive antigens contained a predicted signal peptide sequence and were classified as outer membrane, surface structures or secreted molecules, and an additional 20{\%} were associated with pathogenicity, adaptation or chaperones. These results show that microarrays allow a more comprehensive analysis of the immune response on an antigen-specific, patient-specific, and population-specific basis, can identify serodiagnostic antigens, and contribute to a more detailed understanding of immunogenicity to this pathogen.},

Many different laboratory-based methods have been introduced and are currently being used. However, such detection is generally limited by sample collection, including nasal swabs and blood analysis. Direct identification from air (specifically, aerosol samples) would be ideal, but such detection has not been very successful due to the difficulty in sample collection and the extremely low pathogen concentration found in aerosol samples. In this review, we will discuss the portable biosensors and/or micro total analysis systems (µTAS) that can be used for monitoring such airborne pathogens, similar to smoke detectors.

The analysis of high-throughput experiment data provided by microarrays becomes increasingly more and more important part of modern biological science. Microarrays allow to conduct genotyping or gene expression experiments on hundreds of thousands of test genes in parallel. Because of the large and constantly growing amount of experimental data the necessity of efficiency, robustness and complete automation of microarray image analysis algorithms is gaining significant attention in the field of microarray processing.

RESULTS

The author presents here an efficient and completely automatic image registration algorithm (that is an algorithm for spots and blocks indexing) that allows to process a wide variety of microarray slides with different parameters of grid and block spacing as well as spot sizes. The algorithm scales linearly with the grid size, the time complexity is O(M), where M is number of rows x number of columns. It can successfully cope with local and global distortions of the grid, such as focal distortions and non-orthogonal transformations. The algorithm has been tested both on CCD and scanned images and showed very good performance-the processing time of a single slide with 44 blocks of 200 x 200 grid points (or 1 760 000 grid points total) was about 10 s.

AVAILABILITY

The test implementation of the algorithm will be available upon request for academics.

Initially, the microarray images are preprocessed using template matching, and block and spot finding takes place.

The proposed method was evaluated using images from the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD).

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

DNA microarray technology yields expression profiles for thousands of genes, in a single hybridization experiment. The quantification of the expression level is performed using image analysis. In this paper we introduce a supervised method for the segmentation of microarray images using classification techniques. The method is able to characterize the pixels of the image as signal, background and artefact.

METHODS AND MATERIAL

The proposed method includes five steps: (a) an automated gridding method which provides a cell of the image for each spot. (b) Three multichannel vector filters are employed to preprocess the raw image. (c) Features are extracted from each pixel of the image. (d) The dimension of the feature set is reduced. (e) Support vector machines are used for the classification of pixels as signal, background, artefacts. The proposed method is evaluated using both real images from the Stanford microarray database and simulated images generated by a microarray data simulator. The signal and the background pixels, which are responsible for the quantification of the expression levels, are efficiently detected.

RESULTS

A quality measure (qindex) and the pixel-by-pixel accuracy are used for the evaluation of the proposed method. The obtained qindex varies from 0.742 to 0.836. The obtained accuracy for the real images is about 98{\%}, while the accuracies for the good, normal and bad quality simulated images are 96, 93 and 71{\%}, respectively. The proposed classification method is compared to clustering-based techniques, which have been proposed for microarray image segmentation. This comparison shows that the classification-based method reports better results, improving the performance by up to 20{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS

The proposed method can be used for segmentation of microarray images with high accuracy, indicating that segmentation can be improved using classification instead of clustering. The proposed method is supervised and it can only be used when training data are available.},

 abstract = {Following the age of genomics having sequenced the human genome, interest is shifted towards the function of genes. This new age of proteomics brings about a change of methods to study the properties of gene products on a large scale. Protein separation technologies are now applied to allow high-throughput purification and characterisation of proteins. Two-dimensional-gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) have become widely used tools in the field of proteomics. At the same time, protein and antibody microarrays have been developed as successor of DNA microarrays to soon allow the proteome-wide screening of protein function in parallel. This review is aimed to introduce this new technology and to highlight its current prospects and limitations.},

In efforts to control the prevalence of infectious disease and develop improved therapies, the scientific community has focused on building a molecular picture of pathogen infection and spread. These studies have been aimed at defining the cellular mechanisms that allow pathogen entry into hosts cells, their replication and transmission, as well as the core mechanisms of host defense against pathogens. The past two decades have demonstrated the valuable implementation of proteomic methods in all these areas of infectious disease research. Here, we provide a perspective on the contributions of mass spectrometry and other proteomics approaches to understanding the molecular details of pathogen infection. Specifically, we highlight methods used for defining the composition of viral and bacterial pathogens and the dynamic interaction with their hosts in space and time. We discuss the promise of MS-based proteomics in supporting the development of diagnostics and therapies, and the growing need for multiomics strategies for gaining a systems view of pathogen infection.},

The indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) is the most frequently used serological test to help confirm exposure to the causative organism. However, despite culture-confirmed disease, patients often have a negative IHA result at presentation and occasionally fail to seroconvert in serial testing. We retrospectively examined results for all patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis from our laboratory between January 1996 and August 2008. One hundred forty patients had a recorded IHA titer at presentation, 71 of which were positive at a titer of 1:40 or greater. Fifty-three patients went on to have subsequent IHAs 1 month or more after presentation. The relationships between IHA responses and clinical features were examined. The presence of bacteremia was significantly associated with a negative IHA at presentation. The coexistence of diabetes was associated with the presence of a positive IHA at presentation. In total, 14 patients (26{\%}) demonstrated persistently negative IHA titers upon serial testing. No clinical factors were found to be significantly associated with this phenomenon. Supplementary testing using melioidosis-specific immunoglobulin G by EIA demonstrated different effects, with only Aboriginal or Torres Straits Islander ethnicity being significantly associated with a positive EIA at presentation. Reasons for these findings are examined, and directions for future research are discussed.},

Solutions have been particularly sought in smartphones as they are capable of spectrometric functions. Our report specifically focuses on development of a practical app for immediate point-of-care (POC) multi-analyte sensing without additional devices. First, the individual positions of the sensors are automatically identified by the smartphone; second, the colours measured at each sensor are digitized based on a correction algorithm; and third, the corrected colours are converted to concentration values by pre-loaded calibration curves. All through these sequential processes, the sensor array taken in a smartphone snapshot undergoes laboratory-level spectrometry. The advantages of inexpensive and convenient paper-based colorimetry and the ubiquitous smartphone are tied to achieve a ready-to-go POC diagnosis.},

Most CVDs are preventable and curable, which is largely dependent on timely and effective interventions, including diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic monitoring. However, these interventions are high-cost in high income countries and are usually lacking in LMICs. Thanks to the rapid development of microfluidics and nanotechnology, lots of portable analytical devices are developed for detection of CVDs at the point-of-care (POC). In the meantime, smartphone, as a versatile and powerful handheld tool, has been employed not only as a reader for microfluidic assays, but also as an analyzer for physiological indexes. In this review, we present a comprehensive introduction of the current status and potential development direction on POC diagnostics for CVDs. First of all, we introduce some main facts about CVDs and their standard diagnostic procedures and methods. Second, we discuss about both commercially available POC devices and developed prototypes for detection of CVDs via immunoassays. Subsequently, we report the advances in smartphone-based readout for microfluidic assays. Finally, we present some examples using smartphone, individually or combined with other components or devices, for CVD monitoring. We envision an integrated smartphone-based system capable of functioning blood tests, disease examination, and imaging will come in the future.},

 abstract = {This paper presents microarray BASICA: an integrated image processing tool for background adjustment, segmentation, image compression, and analysis of cDNA microarray images. BASICA uses a fast Mann-Whitney test-based algorithm to segment cDNA microarray images, and performs postprocessing to eliminate the segmentation irregularities. The segmentation results, along with the foreground and background intensities obtained with the background adjustment, are then used for independent compression of the foreground and background. We introduce a new distortion measurement for cDNA microarray image compression and devise a coding scheme by modifying the embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) algorithm (Taubman, 2000) to achieve optimal rate-distortion performance in lossy coding while still maintaining outstanding lossless compression performance. Experimental results show that the bit rate required to ensure sufficiently accurate gene expression measurement varies and depends on the quality of cDNA microarray images. For homogeneously hybridized cDNA microarray images, BASICA is able to provide from a bit rate as low as 5 bpp the gene expression data that are                                                                        {\%} in agreement with those of the original 32 bpp images.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Protein microarrays are a versatile and widely used tool for analyzing complex protein mixtures. Membrane arrays utilize antibodies which are captured on a membrane to specifically immobilize several proteins of interest at once. Using detection antibodies, the bound protein-antibody-complex is converted into visual signals, which can be quantified using densitometry. The reliability of such densitometric assessments depends on a variety of factors, not only sample preparation and the choice of acquisition device but also the selected analysis software and the algorithms used for readout and processing data. Currently available software packages use a single image of a membrane at an optimal exposure time selected for that specific experimental framework. This selection is based on a user's best guess and is subject to inter-user variability or the acquisition device algorithm. With modern image acquisition systems proving the capacity to collect signal development over time, this information can be used to improve densitometric measurements. Here we introduce proMAD, a toolkit for protein microarray analysis providing a novel systemic approach for the quantification of membrane arrays based on the kinetics of the analytical reaction.

RESULTS

Briefly, our toolkit ensures an exact membrane alignment, utilizing basic computer vision techniques. It also provides a stable method to estimate the background light level. Finally, we model the light production over time, utilizing the knowledge about the reaction kinetics of the underlying horseradish peroxidase-based signal detection method.

CONCLUSION

proMAD incorporates the reaction kinetics of the enzyme to model the signal development over time for each membrane creating an individual, self-referencing concept. Variations of membranes within a given experimental set up can be accounted for, allowing for a better comparison of such. While the open-source library can be implemented in existing workflows and used for highly user-tailored analytic setups, the web application, on the other hand, provides easy platform-independent access to the core algorithm to a wide range of researchers. proMAD's inherent flexibility has the potential to cover a wide range of use-cases and enables the automation of data analytic tasks.},

Ratios of relative abundance of nucleic acids are derived from images of regular arrays of spots containing target genetic material to which fluorescently labeled samples are hybridized. Whereas there are a number of methods in use for the quantification of images, many of the software systems in wide use either encourage or require extensive human interaction at the level of individual spots on arrays. We present a fully automatic system for microarray image quantification. The system automatically locates both subarray grids and individual spots, requiring no user identification of any image coordinates. Ratios are computed based on explicit segmentation of each spot. On a typical image of 6000 spots, the entire process takes less than 20 sec. We present a quantitative assessment of performance on multiple replicates of genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization experiments. By explicitly identifying the pixels in each spot, the system yields more accurate estimates of ratios than systems assuming spot circularity.

We propose a Markov random field (MRF) based approach to high-level grid segmentation, which is robust to common problems encountered with array images and does not require calibration. We also propose an active contour method for single-spot segmentation. Active contour models describe objects in images by properties of their boundaries. Both MRFs and active contour models have been used in various other computer vision applications. The traditional active contour model must be generalized for successful application to microarray spot segmentation. Our active contour model is employed for spot detection in the MRF score functions as well as for spot signal segmentation in quantitative array image analysis. An evaluation using several image series from different sources shows the robustness of our methods.},

The effect of global warming depends on the complex interaction between the human host population and the causative infectious agent. From the human standpoint, changes in the environment may trigger human migration, causing disease patterns to shift. Crop failures and famine may reduce host resistance to infections. Disease transmission may be enhanced through the scarcity and contamination of potable water sources. Importantly, significant economic and political stresses may damage the existing public health infrastructure, leaving mankind poorly prepared for unexpected epidemics. Global warming will certainly affect the abundance and distribution of disease vectors. Altitudes that are currently too cool to sustain vectors will become more conducive to them. Some vector populations may expand into new geographic areas, whereas others may disappear. Malaria, dengue, plague, and viruses causing encephalitic syndromes are among the many vector-borne diseases likely to be affected. Some models suggest that vector-borne diseases will become more common as the earth warms, although caution is needed in interpreting these predictions. Clearly, global warming will cause changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. The ability of mankind to react or adapt is dependent upon the magnitude and speed of the change. The outcome will also depend on our ability to recognize epidemics early, to contain them effectively, to provide appropriate treatment, and to commit resources to prevention and research.},

Application of edge detection technology on separating spots from the background decreases the probability of the errors and gives more accurate information about the states of spots such as the pixel number, degree of fragmentation, width and height of spot, and circumference of spot. Such information can be used for the quality control of cDNA microarray experiments and filtering of low quality spots.

@article{Kohler.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei causes the infectious disease melioidosis with a high case-fatality rate in tropical and subtropical regions. Direct pathogen detection can be difficult, and therefore an indirect serological test which might aid early diagnosis is desirable. However, current tests for antibodies against B. pseudomallei, including the reference indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA), lack sensitivity, specificity and standardization. Consequently, serological tests currently do not play a role in the diagnosis of melioidosis in endemic areas. Recently, a number of promising diagnostic antigens have been identified, but a standardized, easy-to-perform clinical laboratory test for sensitive multiplex detection of antibodies against B. pseudomallei is still lacking.

METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

In this study, we developed and validated a protein microarray which can be used in a standard 96-well format. Our array contains 20 recombinant and purified B. pseudomallei proteins, previously identified as serodiagnostic candidates in melioidosis. In total, we analyzed 196 sera and plasmas from melioidosis patients from northeast Thailand and 210 negative controls from melioidosis-endemic and non-endemic regions. Our protein array clearly discriminated between sera from melioidosis patients and controls with a specificity of 97{\%}. Importantly, the array showed a higher sensitivity than did the IHA in melioidosis patients upon admission (cut-off IHA titer $\geq$1:160: IHA 57.3{\%}, protein array: 86.7{\%}; p = 0.0001). Testing of sera from single patients at 0, 12 and 52 weeks post-admission revealed that protein antigens induce either a short- or long-term antibody response.

CONCLUSIONS

Our protein array provides a standardized, rapid, easy-to-perform test for the detection of B. pseudomallei-specific antibody patterns. Thus, this system has the potential to improve the serodiagnosis of melioidosis in clinical settings. Moreover, our high-throughput assay might be useful for the detection of anti-B. pseudomallei antibodies in epidemiological studies. Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical and diagnostic significance of the different antibody kinetics observed during melioidosis.},

Gene expression levels are obtained from microarray experiments through the extraction of pixel intensities from a scanned image of the slide. It is widely acknowledged that variabilities can occur in expression levels extracted from the same images by different users with the same software packages. These inconsistencies arise due to differences in the refinement of the placement of the microarray 'grids'. We introduce a novel automated approach to the refinement of grid placements that is based upon the use of Bayesian inference for determining the size, shape and positioning of the microarray 'spots', capturing uncertainty that can be passed to downstream analysis.

RESULTS

Our experiments demonstrate that variability between users can be significantly reduced using the approach. The automated nature of the approach also saves hours of researchers' time normally spent in refining the grid placement.},

Although numerous algorithms have been developed for microarray segmentation, extensive comparisons between the algorithms have acquired far less attention. In this study, we evaluate the performance of nine microarray segmentation algorithms. Using both simulated and real microarray experiments, we overcome the challenges in performance evaluation, arising from the lack of ground-truth information. The usage of simulated experiments allows us to analyze the segmentation accuracy on a single pixel level as is commonly done in traditional image processing studies. With real experiments, we indirectly measure the segmentation performance, identify significant differences between the algorithms, and study the characteristics of the resulting gene expression data.

RESULTS

Overall, our results show clear differences between the algorithms. The results demonstrate how the segmentation performance depends on the image quality, which algorithms operate on significantly different performance levels, and how the selection of a segmentation algorithm affects the identification of differentially expressed genes.

This study aims to identify the main characteristics of imported and diagnosed melioidosis cases in Europe to increase clinician's awareness of this diagnosis. A literature review of imported and diagnosed human melioidosis cases in Europe was performed. PubMed and Web of Science search engines were used for retrieving articles from 2000 to November 2018. Seventy-seven cases of imported melioidosis into Europe described in the literature were identified. More than half of the cases were acquired in Thailand (53{\%}) by men (73{\%}). Patients were usually exposed to Burkholderia pseudomallei during a holiday stay (58{\%}) of less than 1~month (23{\%}) and were hospitalized during the month following their return to Europe (58{\%}). Among travelers, melioidosis is less often associated with risk factor (16{\%}), diabetes being the most frequently comorbidity related (19{\%}). The clinical presentation was multifaceted, pneumonia being the most common symptom (52{\%}), followed by cardiovascular form (45{\%}) and skin and soft tissues damages (35{\%}). The diagnosis was obtained by culture (92{\%}), often supplemented by morphological, biochemical, and molecular identification (23{\%}). Misdiagnoses were common (21{\%}). Over half of the patients received a complete and adapted treatment (56{\%}). Mortality is lower for returning traveler (6{\%}). Imported melioidosis cases into Europe have their own characteristics. This possibility should be considered in patients with pneumonia, fever, and/or abscess returning from endemic areas even years after.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

Inner holes, artifacts and blank spots are common in microarray images, but current image analysis methods do not pay them enough attention. We propose a new robust model-based method for processing microarray images so as to estimate foreground and background intensities. The method starts with a very simple but effective automatic gridding method, and then proceeds in two steps. The first step applies model-based clustering to the distribution of pixel intensities, using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to choose the number of groups up to a maximum of three. The second step is spatial, finding the large spatially connected components in each cluster of pixels. The method thus combines the strengths of the histogram-based and spatial approaches. It deals effectively with inner holes in spots and with artifacts. It also provides a formal inferential basis for deciding when the spot is blank, namely when the BIC favors one group over two or three.

RESULTS

We apply our methods for gridding and segmentation to cDNA microarray images from an HIV infection experiment. In these experiments, our method had better stability across replicates than a fixed-circle segmentation method or the seeded region growing method in the SPOT software, without introducing noticeable bias when estimating the intensities of differentially expressed genes.

AVAILABILITY

spotSegmentation, an R language package implementing both the gridding and segmentation methods is available through the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org). The segmentation method requires the contributed R package MCLUST for model-based clustering (http://cran.us.r-project.org).

 abstract = {Lateral flow biosensors are a leading technology in point-of-care diagnostics due to their simplicity, rapidness and low cost. Their primacy in this arena continues through technological breakthroughs such as multiplexing: the detection of more than one biomarker in a single assay. Multiplexing capacity is critical for improving diagnostic efficiency, enhancing the diagnostic precision for specific diseases and reducing diagnostic cost. Here we review, for the first time, the various types and strategies employed for creating multiplexed lateral flow biosensors. These are classified into four main categories in terms of specific application or multiplexing level, namely linear, parameter, spatial and conceptual. We describe the practical applications and implications for each approach and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Importantly, multiplexing is still subject to limitations of the traditional lateral flow biosensor, such as sensitivity and specificity. However, by pushing the limitations of the traditional medium into the multiplex arena, several technological breakthroughs are emerging with novel solutions that further expand the utility of lateral flow biosensing for point-of-care applications.},

 abstract = {Burkholderia pseudomallei, a highly pathogenic bacterium that causes melioidosis, is commonly found in soil in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia1,2. Melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose due to its diverse clinical manifestations and the inadequacy of conventional bacterial identification methods3. The bacterium is intrinsically resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials, and treatment with ineffective antimicrobials may result in case fatality rates (CFRs) exceeding 70{\%}4,5. The importation of infected animals has, in the past, spread melioidosis to non-endemic areas6,7. The global distribution of B. pseudomallei and the burden of melioidosis, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we map documented human and animal cases and the presence of environmental B. pseudomallei and combine this in a formal modelling framework8--10 to estimate the global burden of melioidosis. We estimate there to be 165,000 (95{\%} credible interval 68,000--412,000) human melioidosis cases per year worldwide, from which 89,000 (36,000--227,000) people die. Our estimates suggest that melioidosis is severely underreported in the 45 countries in which it is known to be endemic and that melioidosis is probably endemic in a further 34 countries that have never reported the disease. The large numbers of estimated cases and fatalities emphasize that the disease warrants renewed attention from public health officials and policy makers. Combining a map of human and animal melioidosis cases and the presence of environmental Burkholderia pseudomallei in a formal modelling framework to estimate the global burden of the disease reveals that it is severely under-reported.},

Microarray data is contaminated by noise and suffers from broken edges and visual artifacts. Without the utilization of a filter, subsequent tasks such as spot identification and gene expression determination cannot be completed. By employing, in a unique cascade processing cycle, nonlinear filtering solutions based on robust order statistics, the procedure: 1) removes both background and high-frequency corrupting noise and 2) correctly identifies edges and spots in cDNA microarray data. The proposed solution operates directly on the microarray data, does not rely on explicit data normalization or spot separation preprocessing, and operates in a robust manner without using heuristically determined design parameters. Other routine microarray processing operations such as shape manipulations and grid adjustments can be used in conjunction with the developed solution in the processing pipeline. Experimentation reported in this paper indicates that the proposed solution yields excellent performance by removing noise and enhancing spot location determination.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Analyzing process and outcome measures for all patients diagnosed with an infection in a hospital, including those suspected of having an infection, requires not only processing of large datasets but also accounting for numerous patient parameters and guidelines. Substantial technical expertise is required to conduct such rapid, reproducible, and adaptable analyses; however, such analyses can yield valuable insights for infection management and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) teams.

OBJECTIVE

The aim of this study was to present the design, development, and testing of RadaR (Rapid analysis of diagnostic and antimicrobial patterns in R), a software app for infection management, and to ascertain whether RadaR can facilitate user-friendly, intuitive, and interactive analyses of large datasets in the absence of prior in-depth software or programming knowledge.

METHODS

RadaR was built in the open-source programming language R, using Shiny, an additional package to implement Web-app frameworks in R. It was developed in the context of a 1339-bed academic tertiary referral hospital to handle data of more than 180,000 admissions.

RESULTS

RadaR enabled visualization of analytical graphs and statistical summaries in a rapid and interactive manner. It allowed users to filter patient groups by 17 different criteria and investigate antimicrobial use, microbiological diagnostic use and results including antimicrobial resistance, and outcome in length of stay. Furthermore, with RadaR, results can be stratified and grouped to compare defined patient groups on the basis of individual patient features.

CONCLUSIONS

AMS teams can use RadaR to identify areas within their institutions that might benefit from increased support and targeted interventions. It can be used for the assessment of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and for visualizing and communicating analyses. RadaR demonstrated the feasibility of developing software tools for use in infection management and for AMS teams in an open-source approach, thus making it free to use and adaptable to different settings.},

This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health. Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as emerging or reemerging infectious diseases are an even more serious threat and have not been adequately examined or discussed in terms of their unique risk characteristics.

 abstract = {Modern strategies in precision medicine require diagnostic tools for fast assessment of biomarkers. A popular and well-established assay format for the rapid detection of disease markers directly at the point of care is the lateral flow assay, which enables medical staff to directly use body fluids such as blood or urine for diagnosis, without the need for a professional laboratory environment. Interleukin-6 and thrombin are clinically relevant biomarkers that are associated with infectious diseases, inflammation, and blood coagulation, and can provide valuable information on the status and treatment responses of patients with COVID-19. This work presents a novel method for the quantification of these biomarkers by using fluorescent green and red quantum dots as labels for interleukin-6 antibodies and thrombin binding aptamers, respectively. For readout, a 3D printed smartphone imager with a built in UV-LED light source is used. Through separation of RGB-channels, the acquired images can be processed to achieve a fully functional duplex lateral flow assay for simultaneous quantification of interleukin-6 and thrombin on the same test line (optical multiplexing). Furthermore, the assay performs well in complex samples (10 {\%} serum samples). In conclusion, this novel combination of antibody and aptamer-based detection in a single lateral flow assay reduces turnaround time, and the user-friendly smartphone imager facilitates availability, particularly in low resource settings.},

 abstract = {Parallel expression analysis of many genes by microarray hybridisation is one of the most promising techniques in functional genomics. The method has been successfully applied many times in medical and biological research. Our work is about automatic methods for the first stages of a microarray data analysis pipeline. Expression analysis by microarray hybridisation is a high throughput technique. While interactive, semi-automatic software is still frequently used for the analysis of scanned array images, it is highly desirable to have automatic procedures which yield better repeatability and constant quality of the expression data for later cluster analyses. Automatic methods must handle noise and the frequently occurring contaminations on microarrays. In large scale microarray experiments, automatic image analysis can save substantial amounts of work. We describe robust image processing methods that find the printed grids of spots in the scanned microarray images without the requirement of special guide spots or specially calibrated equipment. Processing of many slides from the same print batch helps to minimize the need for human intervention. We derive our method of spot intensity ratio computation from the biochemical model of differential gene expression experiments and finally discuss how different ratio computation methods can be compared. We compare results of our method to results of manual analyses using the well-known Scanalyze (M. Eisen, LBNL Berkeley) as well as recently published methods (Brown et al. (2001), PNAS 92, 8944-8949). Our automatic method yields comparable or even more accurate results than standard methods under poor hybridisation and scan quality conditions.},

The program presented here is designed to analyze automatically images from hybridization experiments with various arrangements: different kinds of probes (oligonucleotides or complex probes), different supports (nylon filters or glass slides), different labeling of probes (radioactively or fluorescently). The program is currently applied to oligonucleotide fingerprinting projects and complex hybridizations. The only precondition for the use of the program is that the targets are arrayed in a grid, which can be approximately transformed to an orthogonal equidistant grid by a projective mapping.RESULTSWe demonstrate that our program can cope with the following problems: global distortion of the grid, missing of grid nodes, local deviation of the spot from its specified grid position. This is checked by different quality measures. The image analysis of oligonucleotide fingerprint experiments on an entire genetic library is used, in clustering procedures, to group related clones together. The results show that the program yields automatically generated high quality input data for follow up analysis such as clustering procedures.AVAILABILITYThe executable files will be available upon request for academics.},

 abstract = {Advancements in molecular technologies have provided new platforms that are being increasingly adopted for use in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Among these, microarray methods are particularly well suited for diagnostics as they allow multiplexing, or the ability to test for multiple targets simultaneously from the same specimen. Microarray technologies commonly used for the detection and identification of microbial targets include solid-state microarrays, electronic microarrays and bead suspension microarrays. Microarray methods have been applied to microbial detection, genotyping and antimicrobial resistance gene detection. Microarrays can offer a panel approach to diagnose specific patient presentations, such as respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, and can discriminate isolates by genotype for tracking epidemiology and outbreak investigations. And, as more information has become available on specific genes and pathways involved in antimicrobial resistance, we are beginning to be able to predict susceptibility patterns based on sequence detection for particular organisms. With further advances in automated microarray processing methods and genotype--phenotype prediction algorithms, these tests will become even more useful as an adjunct or replacement for conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing, allowing for more rapid selection of targeted therapy for infectious diseases.},

Accordingly, application of deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insight from data has been emphasized in both academia and industry. Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics, presenting examples of current research. To provide a useful and comprehensive perspective, we categorize research both by the bioinformatics domain (i.e. omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architecture (i.e. deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, emergent architectures) and present brief descriptions of each study. Additionally, we discuss theoretical and practical issues of deep learning in bioinformatics and suggest future research directions. We believe that this review will provide valuable insights and serve as a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning approaches in their bioinformatics studies.},

 abstract = {Saliva is an emerging biofluid with a significant number of applications in use across research and clinical settings. The present paper explores the reasons why saliva has grown in popularity in recent years, balancing both the potential strengths and weaknesses of this biofluid. Focusing on reasons why saliva is different from other common biological fluids such as blood, urine, or tears, we review how saliva is easily obtained, with minimal risk to the donor, and reduced costs for collection, transportation, and analysis. We then move on to a brief review of the history and progress in rapid salivary testing, again reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of rapid immunoassays (e.g., lateral flow immunoassay) compared to more traditional immunoassays. We consider the potential for saliva as an alternative biofluid in a setting where rapid results are important. We focus the review on salivary tests for small molecule biomarkers using cortisol as an example. Such salivary tests can be applied readily in a variety of settings and for specific measurement purposes, providing researchers and clinicians with opportunities to assess biomarkers in real time with lower transportation, collection, and analysis costs, faster turnaround time, and minimal training requirements. We conclude with a note of cautious optimism that the field will soon gain the ability to collect and analyze salivary specimens at any location and return viable results within minutes.},

In this paper, clustering-based image segmentation is described to extract the target intensity of the microarray spots. While the technique is generic, its effectiveness on extracting spot intensities on arrays obtained from a two-color (Cy3/Cy5) experiment is discussed. The approximate boundaries of the spots are determined initially by manual alignment of rectangular grids. The pixel intensities of the image (I) inside a grid, is mapped onto a one-dimensional vector (v). The k-means clustering technique is applied to generate a binary partition of v. The median value of the pixel intensities inside each of the clusters for a given spot determines its foreground and the local background intensity. The difference in the median value of the foreground and the background intensity is the desired target intensity of the spot. The results are compared against those obtained using a region growing approach.},

 abstract = {Infectious diseases continue to cause an enormous burden of death and disability in developing countries. Increasing access to appropriate treatment for infectious diseases could have a major impact on disease burden. Some common infections can be managed syndromically without the need for diagnostic tests, but this is not appropriate for many infectious diseases, in which a positive diagnostic test is needed before treatment can be given. Since many people in developing countries do not have access to laboratory services, diagnosis depends on the availability of point of care (POC) tests. Historically there has been little investment in POC tests for diseases that are common in developing countries, but that is now changing. Lack of regulation of diagnostic tests in many countries has resulted in the widespread use of sub-standard POC tests, especially for malaria, making it difficult for manufacturers of reliable POC tests to compete. In recent years increased investment, technological advances, and greater awareness about the importance of reliable diagnostic tests has resulted in rapid progress. Rapid, reliable and affordable POC tests, requiring no equipment and minimal training, are now available for HIV infection, syphilis and malaria, but POC tests for other infections are urgently needed. Many countries do not have established criteria for licensing and introducing new diagnostic tests, and many clinicians in developing countries have become disillusioned with diagnostic tests and prefer to rely on clinical judgment. Continuing advocacy and training in the use of POC tests are needed, and systems for quality control of POC tests need to be developed if they are to achieve their maximum potential.},

Burkholderia pseudomallei (a gram-negative bacterium) is the major causative agent for melioidosis, which is prevalent in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Northern Australia. Melioidosis patients are increasingly being recognized in other parts of the world. The bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents, but prolonged treatment, especially with combinations of antibiotics, may be effective. Despite therapy, the overall case fatality rate of septicemia in melioidosis remains significantly high. Intracellular survival of the bacteria within macrophages may progress to chronic infections, and about 10{\%} of patients suffer relapses. In the coming decades, melioidosis will increasingly afflict travelers throughout many global regions. Clinicians managing travelers returning from the subtropics or tropics with severe pneumonia or septicemia should consider acute melioidosis as a differential diagnosis. Patients with open skin wounds, diabetes, or chronic renal disease are at higher risk for melioidosis and should avoid direct contact with soil and standing water in endemic regions. Furthermore, there are fears that B. pseudomallei may be used as a biological weapon. Technological advancements in molecular diagnostics and antibiotic therapy are improving the disease outcomes in endemic areas throughout Asia. Research and development efforts on vaccine candidates against melioidosis are ongoing.},

Our motivation for this work is the lack of automation in high-throughput microarray data analysis that leads to a) spatial inaccuracy of located spots and hence inaccuracy of extracted information from a spot and b) inconsistency of extracted features due to manual selection of grid alignment parameters. The proposed grid alignment algorithm is novel in the sense that 1) it can detect irregularly row- and column-spaced spots in a 2-D array, 2) it is independent of spot color and size, 3) it is general to localize a grid of other primitive shapes than the spot shapes, 4) it can perform grid alignment on any number of input channels, 5) it reduces the number of free parameters to minimum by data driven optimization of most algorithmic parameters, and 6) it has a built-in speed versus accuracy tradeoff mechanism to accommodate user{\&}{\#}39;s requirements on performance time and accuracy of the results. The developed algorithm also automatically identifies multiple blocks of 2-D arrays, as it is the case in microarray images, and compensates for grid rotations in addition to grid translations.},

It has become clear that the classical approaches based on 2-DE and/or MS need to be complemented by different kinds of technologies.

We suggest that the new technologies for clinical proteomics can be supported by antibody-centric protein microarray platforms. These platforms presently include antibody microarrays and lysate, or reverse capture/reverse phase protein microarrays. Other forms of these arrays are in less mature developmental stages, including ORF and self assembling protein microarrays. Bioinformatic support for interpreting these arrays is becoming more available as the whole field of systems biology begins to mature. The present set of applications for these platforms is profoundly focused on certain common cancers, immunology, and cystic fibrosis. However, we predict that many more disease entities will become studied as knowledge of the power and availability of these platforms becomes more widely established. We anticipate that these platforms will eventually evolve to accommodate label-free detection technologies, human genome-scale numbers of analytes, and increases in analytic and bioinformatic speeds.},

The major bottleneck in implementing microarray technology in resource-limited settings lies in the detection instrument used for generating images of spotted oligonucleotides post-hybridization. While various methods such as a lateral flow assay have been presented to accomplish point-of-care disease detection, there is no simple and effective instrument available to gather spot images maintaining the standard microarray procedures. Nanotechnology based sensors connected with a portable smartphone readout system have the potential to be implemented in microarray technology. Here, we describe a portable fluorescence microarray based imaging system connected to a smartphone for detecting breast cancer gene expression (BRCA-1) from exon 11. This is based on the interactive binding of probe DNA to Cy3-target DNA. A paper-based microfluidics approach was used to demonstrate the DNA hybridization assay. The imaging principles of the assembled device named {\textquotedbl}FluoroZen{\textquotedbl} are similar to those of a fluorescence microscope. It uses two light spectrum filters, one to excite the fluorescent dye and the other to capture the emission spectrum. The images were acquired by using CCD cameras from FluoroZen.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The definition of a distance measure plays a key role in the evaluation of different clustering solutions of gene expression profiles. In this empirical study we compare different clustering solutions when using the Mutual Information (MI) measure versus the use of the well known Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation coefficient.

RESULTS

Relying on several public gene expression datasets, we evaluate the homogeneity and separation scores of different clustering solutions. It was found that the use of the MI measure yields a more significant differentiation among erroneous clustering solutions. The proposed measure was also used to analyze the performance of several known clustering algorithms. A comparative study of these algorithms reveals that their {\textquotedbl}best solutions{\textquotedbl} are ranked almost oppositely when using different distance measures, despite the found correspondence between these measures when analysing the averaged scores of groups of solutions.

CONCLUSION

In view of the results, further attention should be paid to the selection of a proper distance measure for analyzing the clustering of gene expression data.},

 abstract = {Following the invention of microarrays in 1994, the development and applications of this technology have grown exponentially. The numerous applications of microarray technology include clinical diagnosis and treatment, drug design and discovery, tumour detection, and environmental health research. One of the key issues in the experimental approaches utilising microarrays is to extract quantitative information from the spots, which represent genes in a given experiment. For this process, the initial stages are important and they influence future steps in the analysis. Identifying the spots and separating the background from the foreground is a fundamental problem in DNA microarray data analysis. In this review, we present an overview of state-of-the-art methods for microarray image segmentation. We discuss the foundations of the circle-shaped approach, adaptive shape segmentation, histogram-based methods and the recently introduced clustering-based techniques. We analytically show that clustering-based techniques are equivalent to the one-dimensional, standard k-means clustering algorithm that utilises the Euclidean distance.},

 abstract = {We are describing immunochromatographic test strips with smart phone-based fluorescence readout. They are intended for use in the detection of the foodborne bacterial pathogens Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were doped with FITC and Ru(bpy), conjugated to the respective antibodies, and then used in a conventional lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Fluorescence was recorded by inserting the nitrocellulose strip into a smart phone-based fluorimeter consisting of a light weight (40~g) optical module containing an LED light source, a fluorescence filter set and a lens attached to the integrated camera of the cell phone in order to acquire high-resolution fluorescence images. The images were analysed by exploiting the quick image processing application of the cell phone and enable the detection of pathogens within few minutes. This LFIA is capable of detecting pathogens in concentrations as low as 105~cfu~mL$-$1 directly from test samples without pre-enrichment. The detection is one order of magnitude better compared to gold nanoparticle-based LFIAs under similar condition. The successful combination of fluorescent nanoparticle-based pathogen detection by LFIAs with a smart phone-based detection platform has resulted in a portable device with improved diagnosis features and having potential application in diagnostics and environmental monitoring.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

To this end, we have developed specific software that creates a virtual image that statistically summarises a series of consecutive scans of a microarray. We provide evidence that the use of multiple imaging (i) enhances the detection of differentially expressed genes; (ii) increases the image homogeneity; and (iii) reveals false-positive results such as differentially expressed genes that are detected by a single scan but not confirmed by successive scanning replicates. The increase in the final number of differentially expressed genes detected in a microarray experiment with this approach is remarkable; 50{\%} more for microarrays hybridised with targets labelled by reverse transcriptase, and 200{\%} more for microarrays developed with the tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technique. The results have been confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR tests.},

 abstract = {Image and statistical analysis are two important stages of cDNA microarrays. Of these, gridding is necessary to accurately identify the location of each spot while extracting spot intensities from the microarray images and automating this procedure permits high-throughput analysis. Due to the deficiencies of the equipment used to print the arrays, rotations, misalignments, high contamination with noise and artifacts, and the enormous amount of data generated, solving the gridding problem by means of an automatic system is not trivial. Existing techniques to solve the automatic grid segmentation problem cover only limited aspects of this challenging problem and require the user to specify the size of the spots, the number of rows and columns in the grid, and boundary conditions. In this paper, a hill-climbing automatic gridding and spot quantification technique is proposed which takes a microarray image (or a subgrid) as input and makes no assumptions about the size of the spots, rows, and columns in the grid. The proposed method is based on a hill-climbing approach that utilizes different objective functions. The method has been found to effectively detect the grids on microarray images drawn from databases from GEO and the Stanford genomic laboratories.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Processing cDNA microarray images is a crucial step in gene expression analysis, since any errors in early stages affect subsequent steps, leading to possibly erroneous biological conclusions. When processing the underlying images, accurately separating the sub-grids and spots is extremely important for subsequent steps that include segmentation, quantification, normalization and clustering.

RESULTS

We propose a parameterless and fully automatic approach that first detects the sub-grids given the entire microarray image, and then detects the locations of the spots in each sub-grid. The approach, first, detects and corrects rotations in the images by applying an affine transformation, followed by a polynomial-time optimal multi-level thresholding algorithm used to find the positions of the sub-grids in the image and the positions of the spots in each sub-grid. Additionally, a new validity index is proposed in order to find the correct number of sub-grids in the image, and the correct number of spots in each sub-grid. Moreover, a refinement procedure is used to correct possible misalignments and increase the accuracy of the method.

CONCLUSIONS

Extensive experiments on real-life microarray images and a comparison to other methods show that the proposed method performs these tasks fully automatically and with a very high degree of accuracy. Moreover, unlike previous methods, the proposed approach can be used in various type of microarray images with different resolutions and spot sizes and does not need any parameter to be adjusted.},

For monitoring of blood concentration levels and treatment of intoxication, highly selective antibodies for digoxin and its hapten, digoxigenin, are available.

Images of lateral flow strips were taken with an iPhone camera and a simple darkbox made from black cardboard.

Because of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis, multiple biomarkers must be analyzed to compensate for the low sensitivity and specificity of single biomarker targets. Conventional LFAs, such as gold nanoparticle dyed assays, are limited to approximately five targets-the maximum number of test lines on an assay. To increase the information obtainable from each test line, we combined green and red emitting quantum dots (QDs) as labels for C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibodies in an optical duplex immunoassay. CdSe-QDs with sharp and tunable emission bands were used to simultaneously quantify CRP and IL-6 in a single test line, by using a single UV-light source and two suitable emission filters for readout through a widely available BioImager device. For image and data processing, a customized software tool, the MultiFlow-Shiny app was used to accelerate and simplify the readout process. The app software provides advanced tools for image processing, including assisted extraction of line intensities, advanced background correction and an easy workflow for creation and handling of experimental data in quantitative LFAs. The results generated with our MultiFlow-Shiny app were superior to those generated with the popular software ImageJ and resulted in lower detection limits. Our assay is applicable for detecting clinically relevant ranges of both target proteins and therefore may serve as a powerful tool for POC diagnosis of inflammation and infectious events.},

 abstract = {DNA microarray is a powerful approach to study simultaneously, the expression of 1000 of genes in a single experiment. The average value of the fluorescent intensity could be calculated in a microarray experiment. The calculated intensity values are very close in amount to the levels of expression of a particular gene. However, determining the appropriate position of every spot in microarray images is a main challenge, which leads to the accurate classification of normal and abnormal (cancer) cells. In this paper, first a preprocessing approach is performed to eliminate the noise and artifacts available in microarray cells using the nonlinear anisotropic diffusion filtering method. Then, the coordinate center of each spot is positioned utilizing the mathematical morphology operations. Finally, the position of each spot is exactly determined through applying a novel hybrid model based on the principle component analysis and the spatial fuzzy c-means clustering (SFCM) algorithm. Using a Gaussian kernel in SFCM algorithm will lead to improving the quality in complementary DNA microarray segmentation.

Microarrays are high-throughput tools for parallel miniaturized detection of biomolecules. In contrast to experiments using ratios of signals in two channels, experiments with only one fluorescent dye cause special problems for data analysis. The present work compares algorithms for quality filtering on spot level as well as array/slide level.

RESULTS

Methods for quantitative spot filtering are discussed and new sets of quality scores for data preprocessing are designed. As measures of spot quality also reflect the quality of protocols, they were employed to find the optimal print buffer in an optimization experiment. In order to determine problematic arrays within a set of replicates we tested methods of outlier detection which can suitably replace the visual inspection of slides.

So far, especially fundamental studies in molecular and cell biology have been conducted using protein microarrays, while the potential for clinical, notably point-of-care applications is not yet fully utilized. The question arises what features have to be implemented and what improvements have to be made in order to fully exploit the technology. In the past we have identified various obstacles that have to be overcome in order to promote protein microarray technology in the diagnostic field. Issues that need significant improvement to make the technology more attractive for the diagnostic market are for instance: too low sensitivity and deficiency in reproducibility, inadequate analysis time, lack of high-quality antibodies and validated reagents, lack of automation and portable instruments, and cost of instruments necessary for chip production and read-out.

Concerted action is needed to address public health issues raised by climate change. In this Review we discuss infections acquired through various routes (arthropod vector, rodent, water, food, and air) in view of a changing climate in Europe. Based on an extensive review of published work and expert workshops, we present an assessment of the infectious disease challenges: incidence, prevalence, and distribution are projected to shift in a changing environment. Due to the high level of uncertainty on the rate of climate change and its impact on infectious diseases, we propose to mount a proactive public health response by building an integrated network for environmental and epidemiological data. This network would have the capacity to connect epidemic intelligence and infectious disease surveillance with meteorological, entomological, water quality, remote sensing, and other data, for multivariate analyses and predictions. Insights from these analyses could then guide adaptation strategies and protect population health from impending threats related to climate change.},

 abstract = {Gridding is the first and most important step to separate the spots into distinct areas in microarray image analysis. Human intervention is necessary for most gridding methods, even if some so-called fully automatic approaches also need preset parameters. The applicability of these methods is limited in certain domains and will cause variations in the gene expression results. In addition, improper gridding, which is influenced by both the misalignment and high noise level, will affect the high throughput analysis. In this paper, we have presented a fully automatic gridding technique to break through the limitation of traditional mathematical morphology gridding methods. First, a preprocessing algorithm was applied for noise reduction. Subsequently, the optimal threshold was gained by using the improved Otsu method to actually locate each spot. In order to diminish the error, the original gridding result was optimized according to the heuristic techniques by estimating the distribution of the spots. Intensive experiments on six different data sets indicate that our method is superior to the traditional morphology one and is robust in the presence of noise. More importantly, the algorithm involved in our method is simple. Furthermore, human intervention and parameters presetting are unnecessary when the algorithm is applied in different types of microarray images.},

 abstract = {Microarray technology plays an important role in drawing useful biological conclusions by analyzing thousands of gene expressions simultaneously. Especially, image analysis is a key step in microarray analysis and its accuracy strongly depends on segmentation. The pioneering works of clustering based segmentation have shown that k-means clustering algorithm and moving k-means clustering algorithm are two commonly used methods in microarray image processing. However, they usually face unsatisfactory results because the real microarray image contains noise, artifacts and spots that vary in size, shape and contrast. To improve the segmentation accuracy, in this article we present a combination clustering based segmentation approach that may be more reliable and able to segment spots automatically. First, this new method starts with a very simple but effective contrast enhancement operation to improve the image quality. Then, an automatic gridding based on the maximum between-class variance is applied to separate the spots into independent areas. Next, among each spot region, the moving k-means clustering is first conducted to separate the spot from background and then the k-means clustering algorithms are combined for those spots failing to obtain the entire boundary. Finally, a refinement step is used to replace the false segmentation and the inseparable ones of missing spots. In addition, quantitative comparisons between the improved method and the other four segmentation algorithms--edge detection, thresholding, k-means clustering and moving k-means clustering--are carried out on cDNA microarray images from six different data sets. Experiments on six different data sets, 1) Stanford Microarray Database (SMD), 2) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), 3) Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), 4) Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), 5) Joe DeRisi's individual tiff files (DeRisi), and 6) University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), indicate that the improved approach is more robust and sensitive to weak spots. More importantly, it can obtain higher segmentation accuracy in the presence of noise, artifacts and weakly expressed spots compared with the other four methods.},

However, state-of-art clustering-based segmentation algorithms are sensitive to noises. To solve this problem and improve the segmentation accuracy, in this article, several improvements are introduced into the fast and simple clustering methods (K-means and Fuzzy C means). Firstly, a contrast enhancement algorithm is implemented in image preprocessing to improve the gridding precision. Secondly, the data-driven means are proposed for cluster center initialization, instead of usual random setting. The third improvement is that the multi features, including intensity features, spatial features, and shape features, are implemented in feature selection to replace the sole pixel intensity feature used in the traditional clustering-based methods to avoid taking noises as spot pixels. Moreover, the principal component analysis is adopted for various feature extraction. Finally, an adaptive adjustment algorithm is proposed based on data mining and learning for further dealing with the missing spots or low contrast spots. Experiments on real and simulation data sets indicate that the proposed improvements made our proposed method obtains higher segmented precision than the traditional K-means and Fuzzy C means clustering methods.},

Image analysis is a major part of data evaluation for array hybridization experiments in molecular biology. The program presented here is designed to analyze automatically images from hybridization experiments with various arrangements: different kinds of probes (oligonucleotides or complex probes), different supports (nylon filters or glass slides), different labeling of probes (radioactively or fluorescently). The program is currently applied to oligonucleotide fingerprinting projects and complex hybridizations. The only precondition for the use of the program is that the targets are arrayed in a grid, which can be approximately transformed to an orthogonal equidistant grid by a projective mapping.

RESULTS

We demonstrate that our program can cope with the following problems: global distortion of the grid, missing of grid nodes, local deviation of the spot from its specified grid position. This is checked by different quality measures. The image analysis of oligonucleotide fingerprint experiments on an entire genetic library is used, in clustering procedures, to group related clones together. The results show that the program yields automatically generated high quality input data for follow up analysis such as clustering procedures.

 abstract = {Melioidosis is an often fatal infectious disease with a protean clinical spectrum, caused by the environmental bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei. Although the disease has been reported from some African countries in the past, the present epidemiology of melioidosis in Africa is almost entirely unknown. Therefore, the common view that melioidosis is rare in Africa is not evidence-based. A recent study concludes that large parts of Africa are environmentally suitable for B. pseudomallei. Twenty-four African countries and three countries in the Middle East were predicted to be endemic, but no cases of melioidosis have been reported yet. In this study, we summarize the present fragmentary knowledge on human and animal melioidosis and environmental B. pseudomallei in Africa and the Middle East. We propose that systematic serological studies in man and animals together with environmental investigations on potential B. pseudomallei habitats are needed to identify risk areas for melioidosis. This information can subsequently be used to target raising clinical awareness and the implementation of simple laboratory algorithms for the isolation of B. pseudomallei from clinical specimens. B. pseudomallei was most likely transferred from Asia to the Americas via Africa, which is shown by phylogenetic analyses. More data on the virulence and genomic characteristics of African B. pseudomallei isolates will contribute to a better understanding of the global evolution of the pathogen and will also help to assess potential differences in disease prevalence and outcome.},

 abstract = {Melioidosis is a severe disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Diagnosis of melioidosis currently relies on the isolation of B. pseudomallei from clinical samples, which can take several days. An indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) is widely used for serodiagnosis, but it has a short shelf life, is poorly standardized, and requires a viable bacteria culture performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. To improve the diagnostic methods, we have developed two rapid latex agglutination tests based on purified B. pseudomallei O-polysaccharide (OPS) and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) antigens. The immunodiagnostic potential of these tests was evaluated using serum from culture-confirmed melioidosis patients (N = 143) and healthy donors from either endemic (N = 199) or non-endemic areas (N = 90). The sensitivity of the OPS-based latex agglutination assay (OPS-latex; 84.4{\%}) was significantly higher than both the CPS-latex (69.5{\%}) (P {\textless} 0.001) and IHA (69.5{\%}) (P = 0.001). When evaluated with Thai donor serum, the OPS-latex had comparable specificity (56.9{\%}) to the CPS-latex (63.8{\%}) (P = 0.053), but was significantly lower than the IHA (67.6{\%}) (P = 0.002). In contrast, all tests with U.S. donor serum were highly specific ($\geq$ 97.8{\%}). These results suggest that polysaccharide-based latex agglutination assays may be useful for serodiagnosis of melioidosis in non-endemic areas.},

 abstract = {In this paper, fluorescent microarray images and various analysis techniques are described to improve the microarray data acquisition processes. Signal intensities produced by rarely expressed genes are initially correctly detected, but they are often lost in corrections for background, log or ratio. Our analyses indicate that a simple correlation between the mean and median signal intensities may be the best way to eliminate inaccurate microarray signals. Unlike traditional quality control methods, the low intensity signals are retained and inaccurate signals are eliminated in this mean and median correlation. With larger amounts of microarray data being generated, it becomes increasingly more difficult to analyze data on a visual basis. Our method allows for the automatic quantitative determination of accurate and reliable signals, which can then be used for normalization. We found that a mean to median correlation of 85{\%} or higher not only retains more data than current methods, but the retained data is more accurate than traditional thresholds or common spot flagging algorithms. We have also found that by using pin microtapping and microvibrations, we can control spot quality independent from initial PCR volume.},

The R/Bioconductor package Protein Array Analyzer (PAA) facilitates a flexible analysis of protein microarrays for biomarker discovery (esp., ProtoArrays). It provides a complete data analysis workflow including preprocessing and quality control, uni- and multivariate feature selection as well as several different plots and results tables to outline and evaluate the analysis results. As a main feature, PAA's multivariate feature selection methods are based on recursive feature elimination (e.g. SVM-recursive feature elimination, SVM-RFE) with stability ensuring strategies such as ensemble feature selection. This enables PAA to detect stable and reliable biomarker candidate panels.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a severe infectious disease with high mortality rates, but is under-recognized worldwide. In endemic areas, there is a great need for simple, low-cost and rapid diagnostic tools. In a previous study we showed, that a protein multiplex array with 20 B. pseudomallei-specific antigens detects antibodies in melioidosis patients with high sensitivity and specificity. In a subsequent study the high potential of anti-B. pseudomallei antibody detection was confirmed using a rapid Hcp1 single protein-based assay. Our protein array also showed that the antibody profile varies between patients, possibly due to a combination of host factors but also antigen variations in the infecting B. pseudomallei strains. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid test, combining Hcp1 and the best performing antigens BPSL2096, BPSL2697 and BPSS0477 from our previous study, to take advantage of simultaneous antibody detection.

METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

The 4-plex dipstick was validated with sera from 75 patients on admission plus control groups, achieving 92{\%} sensitivity and 97-100{\%} specificity. We then re-evaluated melioidosis sera with the 4-plex assay that were previously misclassified by the monoplex Hcp1 rapid test. 12 out of 55 (21.8{\%}) false-negative samples were positive in our new dipstick assay. Among those, 4 sera (7.3{\%}) were Hcp1 positive, whereas 8 (14.5{\%}) sera remained Hcp1 negative but gave a positive reaction with our additional antigens.

CONCLUSIONS

Our dipstick rapid test represents an inexpensive, standardized and simple diagnostic tool with an improved serodiagnostic performance due to multiplex detection. Each additional band on the test strip makes a false-positive result more unlikely, contributing to its reliability. Future prospective studies will seek to validate the gain in sensitivity and specificity of our multiplex rapid test approach in different melioidosis patient cohorts.},

Microarray images typically contain several thousands of small spots, each of which represents a different gene in the experiment. One of the key steps in extracting information from a microarray image is the segmentation whose aim is to identify which pixels within an image represent which gene. This task is greatly complicated by noise within the image and a wide degree of variation in the values of the pixels belonging to a typical spot. In the past there have been many methods proposed for the segmentation of microarray image. In this paper, a new method utilizing a series of artificial neural networks, which are based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Kohonen networks, is proposed. The proposed method is applied to a set of real-world cDNA images. Quantitative comparisons between the proposed method and commercial software GenePix({\circledR}) are carried out in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). This method is shown to not only deliver results comparable and even superior to existing techniques but also have a faster run time.},

 abstract = {Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative environmental bacterium and the aetiological agent of melioidosis, a life-threatening infection that is estimated to account for $\sim$89,000 deaths per year worldwide. Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for melioidosis, and the global diabetes pandemic could increase the number of fatalities caused by melioidosis. Melioidosis is endemic across tropical areas, especially in southeast Asia and northern Australia. Disease manifestations can range from acute septicaemia to chronic infection, as the facultative intracellular lifestyle and virulence factors of B. pseudomallei promote survival and persistence of the pathogen within a broad range of cells, and the bacteria can manipulate the host's immune responses and signalling pathways to escape surveillance. The majority of patients present with sepsis, but specific clinical presentations and their severity vary depending on the route of bacterial entry (skin penetration, inhalation or ingestion), host immune function and bacterial strain and load. Diagnosis is based on clinical and epidemiological features as well as bacterial culture. Treatment requires long-term intravenous and oral antibiotic courses. Delays in treatment due to difficulties in clinical recognition and laboratory diagnosis often lead to poor outcomes and mortality can exceed 40{\%} in some regions. Research into B. pseudomallei is increasing, owing to the biothreat potential of this pathogen and increasing awareness of the disease and its burden; however, better diagnostic tests are needed to improve early confirmation of diagnosis, which would enable better therapeutic efficacy and survival.},

Income growth is associated with rising animal protein consumption in developing countries, which increases the conversion of wild lands to livestock production, and hence the probability of zoonotic emergence. Urbanization implies the greater concentration and connectedness of people, which increases the speed at which new infections are spread. Globalization-the closer integration of the world economy-has facilitated pathogen spread among countries through the growth of trade and travel. High-risk areas for the emergence and spread of infectious disease are where these three trends intersect with predisposing socioecological conditions including the presence of wild disease reservoirs, agricultural practices that increase contact between wildlife and livestock, and cultural practices that increase contact between humans, wildlife, and livestock. Such an intersection occurs in China, which has been a {\textquotedbl}cradle{\textquotedbl} of zoonoses from the Black Death to avian influenza and SARS.

 abstract = {A new integrated image analysis package with quantitative quality control schemes is described for cDNA microarray technology. The package employs an iterative algorithm that utilizes both intensity characteristics and spatial information of the spots on a microarray image for signal-background segmentation and defines five quality scores for each spot to record irregularities in spot intensity, size and background noise levels. A composite score q(com) is defined based on these individual scores to give an overall assessment of spot quality. Using q(com) we demonstrate that the inherent variability in intensity ratio measurements is closely correlated with spot quality, namely spots with higher quality give less variable measurements and vice versa. In addition, gauging data by q(com) can improve data reliability dramatically and efficiently. We further show that the variability in ratio measurements drops exponentially with increasing q(com) and, for the majority of spots at the high quality end, this improvement is mainly due to an improvement in correlation between the two dyes. Based on these studies, we discuss the potential of quantitative quality control for microarray data and the possibility of filtering and normalizing microarray data using a quality metrics-dependent scheme.},

However, such approaches do not address the needs of the majority of the world's people afflicted with infectious diseases, who have, at best, access to poorly resourced health care facilities with almost no supporting clinical laboratory infrastructure. A major challenge for the biomedical engineering community is to develop diagnostic tests to meet the needs of these people, the majority of whom are in the developing world.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Microarray image analysis processes scanned digital images of hybridized arrays to produce the input spot-level data for downstream analysis, so it can have a potentially large impact on those and subsequent analysis. Signal saturation is an optical effect that occurs when some pixel values for highly expressed genes or peptides exceed the upper detection threshold of the scanner software (2(16) - 1 = 65, 535 for 16-bit images). In practice, spots with a sizable number of saturated pixels are often flagged and discarded. Alternatively, the saturated values are used without adjustments for estimating spot intensities. The resulting expression data tend to be biased downwards and can distort high-level analysis that relies on these data. Hence, it is crucial to effectively correct for signal saturation.

RESULTS

We developed a flexible mixture model-based segmentation and spot intensity estimation procedure that accounts for saturated pixels by incorporating a censored component in the mixture model. As demonstrated with biological data and simulation, our method extends the dynamic range of expression data beyond the saturation threshold and is effective in correcting saturation-induced bias when the lost information is not tremendous. We further illustrate the impact of image processing on downstream classification, showing that the proposed method can increase diagnostic accuracy using data from a lymphoma cancer diagnosis study.

CONCLUSIONS

The presented method adjusts for signal saturation at the segmentation stage that identifies a pixel as part of the foreground, background or other. The cluster membership of a pixel can be altered versus treating saturated values as truly observed. Thus, the resulting spot intensity estimates may be more accurate than those obtained from existing methods that correct for saturation based on already segmented data. As a model-based segmentation method, our procedure is able to identify inner holes, fuzzy edges and blank spots that are common in microarray images. The approach is independent of microarray platform and applicable to both single- and dual-channel microarrays.},

Metaphase chromosomes from lymphocytes which had incorporated 5-bromodeoxyuridine for two replication cycles were treated with the dye 33258 Hoechst and photodegraded so that the sister chromatids exhibited differential Giemsa staining. A computer-controlled television-microscope system was used to acquire digitized metaphase spread images by direct scanning of microscope slides. Individual objects in the images were identified by a thresholding procedure. The probability that each object was a single, separate chromosome was estimated from size and shape measurements. An analysis of the spatial relationships of the dark-chromatid regions of each object yielded a set of possible exchange locations and estimated probabilities that such locations corresponded to sister chromatid exchanges. A normalized estimate of the sister chromatid exchange frequency was obtained by summing the joint probabilities that a location contained an exchange within a single, separate chromosome over the set of chromosomes from one or more cells and dividing by the expected value of the total chromosome area analyzed. Comparison with manual scoring of exchanges showed satisfactory agreement up to levels of approximately 30 sister chromatid exchanges/cell, or slightly more than twice control levels. The processing time for this automated sister chromatid exchange detection system was comparable to that of manual scoring.},

@article{Zahurak.2007,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Pre-processing methods for two-sample long oligonucleotide arrays, specifically the Agilent technology, have not been extensively studied. The goal of this study is to quantify some of the sources of error that affect measurement of expression using Agilent arrays and to compare Agilent's Feature Extraction software with pre-processing methods that have become the standard for normalization of cDNA arrays. These include log transformation followed by loess normalization with or without background subtraction and often a between array scale normalization procedure. The larger goal is to define best study design and pre-processing practices for Agilent arrays, and we offer some suggestions.

RESULTS

Simple loess normalization without background subtraction produced the lowest variability. However, without background subtraction, fold changes were biased towards zero, particularly at low intensities. ROC analysis of a spike-in experiment showed that differentially expressed genes are most reliably detected when background is not subtracted. Loess normalization and no background subtraction yielded an AUC of 99.7{\%} compared with 88.8{\%} for Agilent processed fold changes. All methods performed well when error was taken into account by t- or z-statistics, AUCs {\textgreater} or = 99.8{\%}. A substantial proportion of genes showed dye effects, 43{\%} (99{\%} CI: 39{\%}, 47{\%}). However, these effects were generally small regardless of the pre-processing method.

CONCLUSION

Simple loess normalization without background subtraction resulted in low variance fold changes that more reliably ranked gene expression than the other methods. While t-statistics and other measures that take variation into account, including Agilent's z-statistic, can also be used to reliably select differentially expressed genes, fold changes are a standard measure of differential expression for exploratory work, cross platform comparison, and biological interpretation and can not be entirely replaced. Although dye effects are small for most genes, many array features are affected. Therefore, an experimental design that incorporates dye swaps or a common reference could be valuable.},

The biosensors and bioelectronics based on smartphone can mainly be classified into biosensors using optics, surface plasmon resonance, electrochemistry, and near-field communication.

Sensor strategies, detector attachments, and coupling methods are highlighted to show designs of the compact, lightweight, and low-cost sensor systems. The performances and advantages of these designs are introduced with their applications in healthcare diagnosis, environment monitoring, and food evaluation. With advances in micro-manufacture, sensor technology, and miniaturized electronics, biosensor and bioelectronic devices on smartphone can be used to perform biochemical detections as common and convenient as electronic tag readout in foreseeable future.},
