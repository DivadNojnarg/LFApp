## Testing our apps: shinyapps.io

Our apps can also be tested on shinyapps.io. The desktop version of our full
purpose analysis app is at

https://lfapp.shinyapps.io/LFAnalysis/

The mobile version is at

https://lfapp.shinyapps.io/mobile_app/


## Installation

The package requires Bioconductor package EBImage, which should be installed
first via

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Install package BiocManager
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) 
  install.packages("BiocManager")
## Use BiocManager to install EBImage
BiocManager::install("EBImage", update = FALSE)
```

Our package depends on the most recent version of package shinyMobile, which 
must be installed from github (https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile) by

```{r}
## Install package remotes
if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) 
  install.packages("remotes")
## Install package shinyMobile
remotes::install_github("RinteRface/shinyMobile")
```

Finally, one can install package LFApp, where all remaining dependencies will
be installed automatically.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Install package LFApp
remotes::install_github("fpaskali/LFApp", build_vignette=TRUE)
```
